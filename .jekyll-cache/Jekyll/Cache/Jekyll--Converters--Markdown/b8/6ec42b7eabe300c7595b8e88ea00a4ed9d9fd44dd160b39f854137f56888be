I"®<p>I just put a <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/611509v1">new paper up on the arXiv</a>, and so I thought I would share it
here. This was the final paper I wrote for my Ph.D., and it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm most proud
of. The paper is called ‚ÄúMetrics for Graph Comparison: a Practitioner‚Äôs Guide.‚Äù</p>

<h1 id="the-basic-idea">The Basic Idea</h1>

<p>Suppose you have two graphs, or even just a single graph that is changing in time. For
example, you might have a social network between students at a school that evolves as
time passes. Below, we see the social network for a particular French elementary school,
which is evolving as the day passes. Each vertex is a person, and each edge indicates
face-to-face contact.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/research/class_graphs.png" alt="Primary School Graphs" /></p>

<p>One important question that we must answer is ‚Äúhow much did the graph change between
times \(t\) and \(t+1\)?‚Äù Said another way, how similar are graphs \(G_t\) and
\(G_{t+1}\)? The central subjects of this paper are the many methods available for
comparing graphs.</p>

<p>We study these methods both by looking at empirical examples like the one above, as well
as by doing a large study of the statistics of comparing various random graph
models. Which graph comparison tool can best distinguish an Erdos-Renyi random graph
from a stochastic blockmodel? What about comparing a random graph with fixed degree
distribution to a preferential attachment graph? Using Monte Carlo simulation of the
graphs, we are able to answer these questions and gain insight into the behavior of our
distances when they are used on a variety of different structures and geometries.</p>

<p>One important focus of the paper is on practicality, and so we only look at distances
that are linear or near-linear (i.e. \(O(n)\) or \(O(n \log n)\)) in the number of
vertices in the graph.<sup id="fnref:fnote1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> More computationally expensive distances may be of
theoretical interest, but for the graphs used in business, which often range upwards of
1 million vertices, they are not feasible to use.</p>

<h1 id="findings">Findings</h1>

<p>There is a lot of nuance in the interpretation of these comparisons - it‚Äôs not as
simplea as ‚Äúmethod X is the best‚Äù. The results depend strongly on the geometric
structural differences you with to learn about the graph. Do you care about total
connectivity? Then just use a simple edit distance. If you care about the community
structure of a graph, then you should probably use a spectral distance.</p>

<p>That said, we find that spectral methods (which are quite standard, and have been around
for some time) are strong performers all around. They are robust, flexible, and have the
added benefit of easy implementation - fast spectral algorithms are ubiquitous in modern
computing packages such a MATLAB, SciPy, and Julia.</p>

<p>For example, here is a plot showing how well the different distances are able to discern
an Erdos-Renyi random graph from a stochastic blockmodel.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/metric_comparison_plot.png" alt="ER_SBM_Comparison" /></p>

<p>Higher numbers mean that the distances can more reliably discern between the two
populations. We see that the adjacency spectral distance \(\lambda^A\) and the
normalized Laplacian spectral distance \(\lambda^{\mathcal L}\) are most reliably able
to pick out the community structure that differentiates between these two models. This
is not surprising, as the spectra of the graph has a direct interpretation in terms of
vibrational modes, which depend critically upon community structure.</p>

<p>If you want to know more, check out <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/611509v1">the full paper</a>. The above result is just one of
a large collection of findings that we lay out. As I said before, the idea isn‚Äôt to come
to a single conclusion; it is to survey the landscape and to compare and contrast these
different tools.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In research, so many people spend so much time developing new methods, and I always
think to myself, ‚ÄúHow does this compare to the standard method? Is it actually an
improvement?‚Äù This paper attempts to take stock of a number of standard and cutting-edge
methods in graph comparison, and see what works best. After spending some time doing a
theoretical analysis of a particular graph distance metric (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07362">my previous paper</a>)
I was curious to see how all the tools available compared to one another.</p>

<p>Also, I‚Äôve implemented many of these distances in my Python library <a href="https://www.github.com/peterewills/netcomp">NetComp</a>, which
you can get via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install netcomp</code>. Check it out, and feel free to post issues and/or
PRs if you want to add to/modify the library.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments what you think! Or feel free to email me if you
have more detailed questions about graph metrics. Happy Friday!</p>
