<p><img src="/assets/images/routeburn.jpg" width="50%" hspace="20" align="right" /></p>

<p>I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative
information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or
statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of
mathematics and computing, and that’s where I like to play.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with <a href="https://www.entelligent.com">Stage 1 start-ups</a> and <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com">publicly traded corporations</a>,
building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to
developers. My mother tongue is Python, but I also speak Scala and Java. I have
experience working with Apache Spark, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, pandas, and many
other popular data analysis and machine learning libraries.</p>

<p>I have a bachelors degree in Physics from Reed College, where I did
<a href="/assets/docs/thesis.pdf">my thesis</a> on measurement of quantum entanglement in optical systems. After
spending some time pursuing other interests,<sup id="fnref:fnote2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fnote2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. My dissertation covers a
range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and understanding noisy
systems. For more details on all that, check out <a href="/portfolio/">my portfolio</a>, or
take a look at <a href="/assets/docs/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.</p>

<p>I currently live in San Francisco, where I work as a data scientist with the
inventory optimization team at <a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/algorithms/">Stitch Fix</a>.</p>

      <p>After graduating from Reed, I spent some time living at
<a href="https://www.zendust.org/monastery">Great Vow Zen Monastery</a>, where we followed a daily schedule of work and
meditation. <a href="#fnref:fnote2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
